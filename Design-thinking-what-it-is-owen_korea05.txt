Abstract
This paper is a keynote speech
given October 21 at the Life
and Design in the Future
Conference held at the Gwangju Design Biennale 2005 in
Gwangju City, Korea. Figures
are the slides from the presentation.

Problems induced by continuing population growth and its pressure on resources and environment have reached a stage where
serious concern must be given to the processes of decision making
being used by governmental and institutional leaders. Science
thinking is frequently unheard or unheeded and design thinking is
not engaged at all.
Design thinking, as a complement to science thinking, embodies a wide range of creative characteristics as well as a number
of other special qualities of distinct value to decision makers. In
advisory roles, properly prepared design professionals could make
substantial contributions to a process now dominated by political
and economic views. This paper examines the nature of design
thinking as it differs from other ways of thinking. A model for
comparing fields is introduced and a number of characteristics of
creative individuals in general and designers in particular are presented.
Preparing designers for participation in policy planning will be
a challenge for design education. Meeting the challenge will
require new understanding, an extended range of design tools, and
concerted support from the design professions to demonstrate the
value of design thinking to decision making at the highest levels.

Figure 1 The Fundamental Problem: Population Growth

The handiwork of humankind is finally beginning to impress itself
on the global environment and on us, its inhabitants. This should
inspire us as design professionals to reconsider what we do, who
our clients are, and where we can best offer our expertise. In particular, the decision processes of high-level decision makers are in
need of serious overhaul.
It is news to no one that current rates of resource consumption
cannot keep up with population growth as it exists (Figure 1).

Key to the use or misuse of these technologies
are the decision processes employed by those in
power (Figure 5). History has shown that political decisions do not always favor the best interests of all, and when critical factors include
information not easily understood by political decision makers, that information may be disregarded or not even considered. My argument in
recent papers2 is that the stakes are now too high
for critical information to be unheard or ignored.
Science advisors have long been included
among high-level governmental advisory staffs.
How their advice is valued, however, has varied
with the problem context, and political interests
have almost always trumped scientific advice.
More than ever before, scientific advice requires
serious consideration. And another kind of thinking deserves equal attention.
Design thinking is in many ways the obverse
of scientific thinking. Where the scientist sifts

Figure 5 Decision Making: Policy Is Made with Advice

A sensitive observer might notice an interesting
thing about creative people. They tend to work
in two different ways (Figure 6).
Those who work in the first way, might best
be called "finders". They exercise their creativity
through discovery. Finders are driven to understand, to find explanations for phenomena not
well understood. In professional life, they usually
become scientists or scholars and are responsible
for much of our progress in understanding ourselves and our surroundings.

Those who work in the second way are
"makers", equally creative, but in a different
way. They demonstrate their creativity through
invention. Makers are driven to synthesize what
they know in new constructions, arrangements,
patterns, compositions and concepts that bring
tangible, fresh expressions of what can be. They
become architects, engineers, artists—designers
—and are responsible for the built environment
in which we live and work.

facts to discover patterns and insights, the designer invents new patterns and concepts to
address facts and possibilities. In a world with
growing problems that desperately need understanding and insight, there is also great need for
ideas that can blend that understanding and
insight in creative new solutions. Implicit in this
notion is the belief that design thinking can
make special, valuable contributions to decision
making. In this paper, I will explore the nature
of that kind of thinking, its value, and the differences between design thinking and other ways of
thinking.

Discovery

again from its present 6.46 billion—with all that
means for our dwindling resources. Coupled with
that, it is at last clear that global warming is fact,
and its growing control over Earth’s climate and
weather systems will unpredictably complicate
problems already made serious by population
pressures (Figures 2 and 3).
The road ahead indeed seems dark, but there
is hope. A profusion of new technologies is
emerging, many with potential to alleviate or
even eliminate the problems induced by population growth. As Jared Diamond points out1, technologically complex societies autocatalyze
technological growth, and the resulting development accelerates over time. We are, in effect, unintentionally creating the highly sophisticated
tools (Figure 4) that may prevent the destruction
initiated with earlier created tools.

Given the fundamental process differences
between how finders and makers think and work,
it is reasonable to believe that other factors
might similarly reveal differences among professional fields and, therefore, help to define the
nature of design thinking. One such factor is the
content with which a field works. A conceptual
"map" can be drawn to use both content and
process factors (Figure 7).
Two axes define the map. Separating the map
into left and right halves is an Analytic/Synthetic
axis that classifies fields by process—the way
they work. Fields on the left side of the axis are
more concerned with "finding" or discovering;
fields on the right with "making" and inventing.
A Symbolic/Real axis divides the map into
halves vertically, according to content or realm
of activity. Fields in the upper half of the map
are more concerned with the abstract, symbolic
world and the institutions, policies and language
tools that enable people to manipulate information, communicate and live together. Fields in
the lower half are concerned with the real world
and the artifacts and systems necessary for managing the physical environment.
A sampling of fields illustrates how the map
differentiates (Figure 8). The five chosen are
highly recognizable with well defined disciplines
and well understood differences. Every field has
component elements in each of the four quadrants. What distinguishes one field from another
is the degree to which a field positions its
"center of gravity" away from the center into the
quadrants and the direction that positioning
takes. In Figure 8, fields close to the center are

more "generalized" with respect to the axes;
fields away from the center are more "specialized".
Science is farthest to the left as a field that is
heavily analytic in its use of process. Its content
is also more symbolic than real in that subject
matter is usually abstracted in its analyses. There
are elements of science, however, that are synthetic in process (as, for example, in materials
science or organic chemistry), and science can
deal directly with unabstracted, real content, particularly in the natural sciences.
Law, as a generalized field, is located higher
on the map, concerned extensively with the symbolic content of institutions, policies and social
relationships. It is also positioned more to the
right, as a significant portion of its disciplines
are concerned with the creation of laws and the
instruments of social contract. Medicine, in contrast, is sharply lower on the content axis, vitally
concerned with the real problems of human
health. On the process scale, it is strongly analytic; diagnostic processes are a primary focus of
medicine. Art is high on the content axis, strongly symbolic, and almost evenly divided on the
process scale, still more synthetic than analytic,
but very much involved with interpretation of the
human condition.
Design in this mapping is highly synthetic
and strongly concerned with real world subject
matter. Because disciplines of design deal with
communications and symbolism, design has a
symbolic component, and because design requires analysis to perform synthesis, there is an
analytic component—but design is a field relatively specialized, and specialized nearly oppositely to science.
For almost any field, a case can be made for
movement to the left or right based on the

Charles L. Owen Design Thinking. What It Is. Why It Is Different. Where It Has New Value.

variety of detailed interests the field subsumes.
Positioning is very subjective, but absolute positioning is not what is important in this kind of
mapping. Relative positioning is. It provides a
means for comparing multi-field relationships
with regard to the two important dimensions of
content and process.

tecture in this century has moved up and down
on the map as various movements have shifted
the discipline’s focus of interest between symbolic and functional goals.
A field’s choice of subject matter and procedure distinguishes it from others. Design, as a
field, clearly occupies a special place on the
map, more complementary to science than any
other field in that, coupled with science, it fills
out the space most completely (Figure 10). The
source of the complementation lies in deeply
rooted differences in ways of thinking. To understand the differences, it is useful to look at how
knowledge is built and used in a field.

Fields, of course, are just the tops of hierarchies,
and the hierarchical nature of their subject matter
opens a door to the examination of relationships
among elements at finer levels of detail (Figure
9). Mechanical engineering, a subject at the discipline level, is nicely centered between the analytic and synthetic domains, but that is only true
when it is considered as a whole. Engineering
science, one of its sub-disciplines, would be
located much farther to the left; engineering
design would be on the right. Decomposing
mathematics produces, among other subspecialties, applied mathematics, which is concerned
more generally with the real domain than is
mathematics, the parent discipline. The complexity of most fields affords opportunities for such
leveling and sharpening through hierarchical examination. Composition is a leveling process,
lessening distinctions and moving more inclusive
concepts, such as fields, toward the center of the
map; decomposition is a sharpening process, revealing differences and dispersing more tightly
defined disciplines and sub-disciplines into the
quadrants.
Movements of fields and disciplines through
time and culture can also be tracked. Through
much of the last two thousand years, for
example, western sculptors rendered realistic
subjects for their clients, commemorating individuals and events. Since the turn of the last
century, cultural trends in the arts have moved
sculpture up and to the left on the map. Archi-

Foundations
In any field, knowledge is generated and accumulated through action: the model is doing
something and evaluating the results. In Figure
11, the process is shown as a cycle in which
knowledge is used to produce works, and works
are evaluated to build knowledge. Knowledge
using and knowledge building are both structured
processes controlled by channels that contain and
direct the production and evaluation processes.

These channels are the systems of conventions
and rules under which a field and its disciplines
operate. They embody the values and integrate
the principles and measures that have evolved as
"ways of doing and knowing" as the field has
matured. They may borrow from or emulate
aspects of other fields’ channels, but over time,
they become custom tailored to a field as products of its evolution.
The general model can be extended to one
that reflects the dual nature of fields and disciplines suggested by the analytic/synthetic dimension of the Map of Fields. In Figure 12, this is
done with an addition of realms of theory and
practice within which paradigms of inquiry and
practice operate3.

Underlying knowledge building and knowledge
using in any field are deep foundation layers that
direct and inform higher levels all the way to the
level of overt procedure. In order from most fundamental to most directly operational, these can
be expressed as needs or goals, values and
measures. Qualities that a field exhibits on the
surface and differences among fields can be best
understood by examining these foundations.
Figure 13 presents the foundation model diagrammatically. At the most fundamental level, a
driving force—a need/goal that must be
satisfied—generates a field. For any well-defined
field this usually can be encapsulated in a word,
the purpose for which the field evolved. For disciplines, as the focused specialties of a field, it is
frequently a need felt strongly and seen purely
enough to enlist individuals in a career.
From a need or goal, values emerge to identify the qualities important to fulfilling the need.
The work of the field is evaluated in terms of
these values. Both needs and values exist at an
abstract level, providing reference and foundation

against which procedures at an operational level
can be tested.
The third and fourth layers of the model take
values into the domain of action. The third layer,
still relatively abstract, is concerned with the interpretation of values into measures that guide
the creation of instruments to manage the processes of knowledge using and building. Measures are conveniently conceptualized as scales.
Because they include expressions for the description of quality at high and low ends, and can
have intermediate descriptions as well, they form
an ideal bridge from single-word notions of
value to evaluative dimensions. Most typically,
measurement scales are bipolar with a "good"
side and a "bad" side (e.g., true/false, right/
wrong, works/doesn’t work, etc.), but they need
not be. Triangular and higher dimension scales
(essentially maps) also work, but are less readily
applied. Further, scales need not be continuous
or even multi-stepped. True/false is perfectly
valid as a binary yes/no proposition. And they
need not be linear; whether steps are uniform or
progressively larger or smaller is not at issue—
the issue is resolution in the measurement of
value.

Figure 13 Foundations: Fields Are Founded upon Values

The value frameworks created by measures guide
the formation of operational methods for producing and judging work. Methods, in turn, combine
into the familiar working procedures and processes that encode the knowledge of the discipline operationally for paradigms of both
application and inquiry.
Figure 14 uses the model to compare design
with the four previously introduced fields. The
measures suggested are examples, by no means a
complete set.
Science is driven by the need for
Understanding. To achieve this goal, it values

Correctness, in the sense that
theories can be evaluated for
whether they are correct, as
best can be determined with
current data. It also values
Thoroughness because understanding must be thorough to
remove uncertainty. Testability
is valued because closure demands that theories be tested
and determined to be correct or
incorrect. These values (and
others) find expression in
measures that expand the essence of the value into tools
that can be incorporated directly or indirectly in frameworks,
methods and procedures. Measures such as True/False, Correct/Incorrect, Complete/
Incomplete, and Provable/ Unprovable exemplify these. Figure 15 isolates them for
Science from the diagram of
Figure 14.
Art, quite different in this
kind of analysis, derives from
the need for Expression. Values
such as Insightfulness, Novelty
and Stimulation highlight important aspects of expression as
it is regarded today, and measures such as Thoughtprovoking/ Banal, Fresh/Stale
and Exciting/Boring particularize these for the criteria to be
used in the production and criticism of art.
Law strives for Justice. Its
values, Fairness, Thoroughness
and Appropriateness,are concerns important to writing the
law and ensuring that it is
properly used in support of
good citizenship. Measures
such as Just/Unjust, Right/
Wrong, Complete/Incomplete,
Appropriate/Inappropriate and
Fair/Unfair draw out the evaluations appropriate to the field.
Medicine shares much with
science, but has its own need
for being in maintaining,

values, Correctness is critical for diagnoses and
procedures, and Effectiveness, a value strongly
shared with design, is relevant when something
is better than nothing. Measures include Correct/Incorrect, Works/Doesn’t work and Better/
Worse.
Design (Figure 16) exists because of the need
for Form. The form giver, in the broadest use of
the term, creates order. Because the world of
design is the world of the artificial, the values of
design tend to be ones associated with human
needs and environmental needs created by or resulting from human actions. Cultural Fit is associated with aesthetic issues; Appropriateness
targets the wide range of physiological, cognitive, social and cultural human factors; and Effectiveness gauges functionality and utility. For
Cultural Fit, good measures are Fresh/Stale,
Fits/Doesn’t Fit and Elegant/Inelegant; for
Appropriateness, Appropriate/Inappropriate and
Works/Doesn’t Work (from the human factors
perspective) are helpful. From a utility perspective, Works/Doesn’t Work, Sustainable/ Unsustainable and Better/Worse measure
Effectiveness.
Seen through the differences in underlying
values, differences among fields become clearer
and more understandable. As a case in point, a
major difference between science and design lies
in the difference between Correctness and Effectiveness as important measures of success. Correct/Incorrect (or True/False) is appropriate for a
field in which there can only be one "true"
answer or correct explanation for an observed
phenomenon. Better/Worse is appropriate for a
field in which multiple solutions can be equally
successful because the conditions for judgment
are culturally based.
From all this, it is easier to see why a combination of science thinking and design thinking is
better than either alone as a source of advice.
Either is valuable, but together they bring the
best of skeptical inquiry into balance with imaginative application. Both are well served by creative thinking. In preparation for a wider
consideration of design thinking, therefore, it is
time to look at the general characteristics of the
creative thinker.

Characteristics of Creative Thinking
Despite great interest and considerable speculation over many years, the nature of creativity,
what makes one person creative and another not,
and the creative process itself, remain elusive.
Nevertheless, a number of characteristics have
been identified and these can be useful in contemplating the nature of creative thinking and, in
particular, creative design thinking as it is and as
we would like it to be.
Fabun’s List
In a special issue of Kaiser Aluminum News
some years ago, editor Don Fabun assembled
characteristics of the creative individual culled
from the observations of a number of thoughtful
writers4. While they are not all-inclusive, they
provide a good start for assembling a catalog
(Figure 17):

Creativity

Fabun’s Characteristics of Creative Individuals
From observations of thoughtful authors (through 1968)
• Sensitivity

• Sustained curiosity

• Questioning attitude

• Time control

• Broad education

• Dedication

• Asymmetical thinking

• Willingness to work

• Personal courage

Figure 17 Creative Characteristics: Don Fabun

• Sensitivity. A propensity for greater awareness which makes a person more readily attuned
to the subtleties of various sensations and impressions. Eric Fromm4 writes, "Creativity is the
ability to see (or be aware) and to respond".
• Questioning attitude. An inquisitiveness,
probably imprinted in early home training that
encourages seeking new and original answers.
• Broad education. An approach to learning
instilled from a liberal education that puts a
premium on questions rather than answers and
rewards curiosity rather than rote learning and
conformity.
• Asymmetrical thinking. The ability to find
an original kind of order in disorder as opposed
to symmetrical thinking that balances everything
out in some logical way. "The creative personality is unique in that during the initial stages he

Charles L. Owen Design Thinking. What It Is. Why It Is Different. Where It Has New Value.

prefers the chaotic and disorderly and tends to
reject what has already been systematized".
Ralph J. Hallman4
• Personal courage. A disregard for failure
derived from a concern, not for what others
think, but what one thinks of oneself. "They
seemed to be less afraid of what other people
would say or demand or laugh at ... Perhaps
more important, however, was their lack of fear
of their own insides, of their own impulses, emo4
tions, thoughts". Abraham Maslow
• Sustained curiosity. A capacity for childlike
wonder carried into adult life that generates a
style of endless questioning, even of the most
4
personally cherished ideas. Eric Fromm : "Children still have the capacity to be puzzled ... But
once they are through the process of education,
most people lose the capacity of wondering, of
being surprised. They feel that they ought to
know everything, and hence that it is a sign of
ignorance to be surprised or puzzled by anything".
• Time control. Instead of being bound by
time, deadlines and schedules, creative individuals use time as a resource—morning, noon and
night—years, decades—whatever it takes,
unbound by the clock.
• Dedication. The unswerving desire to do
something, whatever it may be and whatever the
obstacles to doing it.
• Willingness to work. The willingness to
continue to pursue a project endlessly, in
working hours and so-called free hours, over
whatever time might be required. Roger
Sessions4 said, "Inspiration, then, is the impulse
which sets creation in movement; it is also the
energy which keeps it going".

Creativity

Arieti’s Characteristics of the Creative Individual
From a study of research available (through 1976)
• Fluency of thinking
• Flexibility
• Originality
• Redefinition
• Elaboration
• Tolerance for ambiguity

Figure 18 Creative Characteristics: Arieti

• Flexibility. The ability to abandon old ways
of thinking and initiate different directions.
• Originality. The ability to produce uncommon responses and unconventional associations.
• Redefinition. The ability to reorganize what
we know or see in new ways.
• Elaboration. The capacity to use two or
more abilities for the construction of a more
complex object.
• Tolerance for ambiguity. The capacity to
entertain conflicting concepts for periods of time
without the need to resolve uncertainties.
Csikszentmihalyi’s Polarities
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, an anthropologist at
the University of Chicago, sees the creative individual in terms of "pairs of apparently antithetical traits that are often both present in such
individuals and integrated with each other in a
6
dialectical tension" (Figure 19).

Creativity

Csikszentmihalyi’s Creative Characteristics

Additions from Arieti
In 1976, psychiatrist Silvano Arieti thoroughly
5
reviewed what was known then about creativity .
From his study, several additional characteristics
can be included (Figure 18):
• Fluency of thinking. Word fluency, the
ability to produce words containing specified
letters or combinations of letters; associational
fluency, the ability to produce synonyms for
given words; expressional fluency, the ability to
juxtapose words to meet the requirements of sentence structure, and ideational fluency, the ability
to produce ideas to fulfill certain requirements—
to offer solutions to problems.

• Generalized libidinal
energy / restraint
• Convergent / divergent
thinking
• Playfulness / discipline
• Fantasy / reality
• Extroversion / introversion

• Humility / pride
• Masculinity / femininity
• Traditional conservatism /
rebellious iconoclasm
• Passion / objectivity
• Suffering / enjoyment

Figure 19 Creative Characteristics: Csikszentmihalyi

• Generalized libidinal energy and restraint.
"Without eros, it would be difficult to take life
on with vigor; without restraint, the energy could
easily dissipate."

• Convergent and divergent thinking. Divergent thinking to generate ideas; convergent
thinking to tell a good one from a bad one.
• Playfulness and discipline—or irresponsibility and responsibility. Exploring ideas widely
and lightly, but surmounting obstacles and bringing ideas to completion with doggedness, endurance and perseverance.
• Fantasy and reality. Breaking away from
the present without losing touch with the past;
finding originality in which novelty is rooted in
reality.
• Extroversion and introversion. Seeing and
hearing people, exchanging ideas, and getting to
know other persons’ work to extend interaction;
working alone to fully explore and master abstract concepts.
• Humility and pride. Humility in the awareness of those who worked before, the element of
luck involved with achievement, and the relative
unimportance of past achievements in comparison with a focus on future projects; pride in the
self-assurance associated with accomplishment.
• Masculinity and femininity. Psychological
androgyny enabling the best traits of bold, assertive masculinity to be combined with the best
traits of sensitive, aware femininity.
• Traditional conservatism and rebellious
iconoclasm. Being able to understand and appreciate a cultural domain and its rules, while at the
same time being willing to take risks to break
with its traditions.
• Passion and objectivity. Passion in the attachment and dedication to the cause or work;
objectivity in the ability to stand apart, detached,
to evaluate quality impartially.
• Suffering and enjoyment. The heightened
highs and lows that come with intense involvement and sensitivity, both to observed quality
and to what others think.
Csikszentmihalyi notes that these conflicting
traits are difficult to find in the same person, but
"the novelty that survives to change a domain is
usually the work of someone who can operate at
both ends of these polarities—and that is the
kind of person we call creative".
Many of these characteristics, especially
among those listed by Csikszentmihalyi, are not
qualities to be taught. At best these are natural
personality traits that can be recognized where
they exist or noted in their absence, but many of
the others can be developed or encouraged, and
this should be done overtly.

Characteristics of Design Thinking
Creativity is of major importance to design
thinking, as it is to science thinking and thinking
in any field. But as is true for each field, characteristics other than creativity are also important.
From personal experience, I would nominate for
design thinking the following characteristics and
ways of working (Figures 20 and 21):

Design Thinking
Characteristics

Observations from design education, research and practice
• Conditioned inventiveness
• Human-centered focus
• Environment-centered concern
• Ability to visualize
• Tempered optimism
• Bias for adaptivity
• Predisposition toward multifunctionality

Figure 20 Design Thinking: Observed Characteristics

Design Thinking
Characteristics

Observations from design education, research and practice
• Systemic vision
• Generalist view
• Ability to use language as a tool
• Affinity for team work
• Facility for avoiding the necessity for choice
• Self-governing practicality
• Ability to work systematically with qualitative information

Figure 21 Design Thinking: Observed Characteristics

• Conditioned inventiveness. Creative thinking for designers is directed toward inventing.
Designers tend to be more interested in the
"what" questions than the "whys" of interest to
the scientist. Design creativity, thus, complements scientific creativity. Design creativity,
however, must cover more than just invention.
Design brings to invention a concern that what is
produced not only be inventive, but be so within
the frameworks of human-centered and
environment-centered measures governing the designer’s efforts.
• Human-centered focus. Science and, to a
slightly lesser extent, technology have few builtin governors. That is to say, as in the arts, exploration proceeds where discoveries direct.

Design, on the other hand, is client-directed.
Design thinking must continually consider how
what is being created will respond to the clients’
needs.
• Environment-centered concern. In recent
years, design thinking has acquired a second,
omnipresent and meta-level client: the environment. Present-day thinking puts environmental
interests at a level with human interests as
primary constraints on the design process. Sustainable design is one very noticeable result, The
ultimate value of human- and environmentcenteredness is a guarantee that the best interests
of humankind and environment will be considered in any project.
• Ability to visualize. All designers work visually. Designers can visualize ideas in a range
of media, bringing a common view to concepts
otherwise imagined uniquely by everyone in a
discussion. Designers can reveal the whole elephant that the blind men can only partially and
imperfectly conceive.
• Tempered optimism. It is difficult to
work—and especially to work creatively—in a
pessimistic, critical mood. Designers are taught
to recognize this and to establish optimistic and
proactive ways of working. Pronounced mood
swings are not unusual among creative individuals, but designers learn to control these to level
out both lows and highs in the interests of
professionalism—designers must be able to turn
on enthusiasm on demand.
• Bias for adaptivity. In recent years, the
emergence of adaptive processes in manufacturing and information technologies has greatly reinforced a practice historically followed by some
designers: the design of adaptive products able to
fit their users’ needs uniquely. Design thinking
today has accepted that concept, approaching
problems with the view that, where possible, solutions should be adaptive—in production, to fit
the needs of users uniquely; throughout their use,
to fit users’ evolving needs.
• Predisposition toward multifunctionality.
Solutions to problems need not be monofunctional. Designers routinely look for multiple
dividends from solutions to problems. This
would seem to be an obvious way to proceed,
but it is not so. In a recent issue of Popular
Science magazine7, the cover story was six new
technologies to stop global warming (Figure 22).
The story reported proposals made by the
science community at a special invited meeting

13

with White House officials. All six science proposals were serious proposals for macroengineering projects. Five of the six proposed
single-minded means for relieving global
warming—at considerable cost, and with no additional benefits. The sixth, as an extension of a
technology already used for increasing natural
gas production, had that benefit, but no other. In
contrast, the three macro design projects (Figure
23) proposed in the Institute of Design’s prize
winning Project Phoenix (also reported in
Popular Science 14 years earlier) all had major
economic benefits in addition to their global
warming benefits8. Design thinking keeps the big
picture in mind while focusing on specifics.

Figure 23 Design Thinking: Proposals for Global Warming

• Systemic Vision. Design thinking is holistic.
In the last forty years, roughly since the computer began to influence design thinking, designers
have moved to considering problems more
broadly. Modern design treats problems as
system problems with opportunities for systemic
solutions involving mixes of hardware, software,
procedures, policies, organizational concepts and
whatever else is necessary to create a holistic solution.

• View of the Generalist. Common wisdom
today holds that the trend of expertise is to
greater and greater specialization and, therefore,
success will come more readily to those who
choose to specialize early and plan their training
accordingly. Design thinking, to the contrary, is
highly generalist in preparation and execution. In
a world of specialists, there is real need for those
who can reach across disciplines to communicate
and who can bring diverse experts together in
coordinated effort. For inventive creativity, the
wider the reach of the knowledge base, the more
likely the creative inspiration. A designer is a
specialist in the process of design, but a generalist in as wide a range of content as possible.
• Ability to use language as a tool. Language
is usually thought of as means for communication. For design thinking, it is also a tool. Visual
language is used diagrammatically to abstract
concepts, reveal and explain patterns, and simplify complex phenomena to their fundamental essences. Mathematical language is used to explore
"what if" questions where feasibility may be established by approximation—by calculations not
exact, but close enough to support an idea or
change a line of reasoning. Verbal language is
used in description where explanation goes hand
in hand with the creative process, forcing invention where detail is lacking and expressing relationships not obvious visually.
• Affinity for teamwork. Because designers
work for clients, it is natural that good interpersonal skills become part of the professional set
of tools they develop. An additional impetus
toward teamwork has been a movement in the
professions over the last forty years toward
team-based design, spurred by developments in
industry. Design thinking today is highly influenced by this, and designers routinely work
closely with other designers and experts from
other fields. On multi-discipline teams, designers
are a highly valuable asset because of their characteristic abilities to generalize, communicate
across disciplines, work systematically with qualitative information, and visualize concepts.
• Facility for avoiding the necessity of
choice. The job of the decision maker is to
choose among alternative proposals, usually the
products of different problem-solving approaches. Design thinking takes the view that making
that choice is a last resort. Before moving to
choice-making, the designer looks for ways to
"have your cake and eat it too"—a seeming

paradox (exactly what you cannot do, as pointed
out in the old English proverb). The optimistic,
adaptive designer, however, searches the competing alternatives for their essential characteristics
and finds ways to reformulate them in a new
configuration. When this process is successful,
the result is a solution that avoids the decision
and combines the best of both possible choices.
• Self-governing practicality. Design is a
field in which inventiveness is prized. In very
few fields is there the freedom to dream expected in design. The best design thinkers understand
this and learn to govern flights of fantasy with a
latent sense of the practical. The flight is to the
outer reaches of what can be conceived; the
tether is to ways that the conceivable might be
realized. This is embedded in a style of thinking
that explores freely in the foreground, while
maintaining in the background a realistic appraisal of costs that can be met and functionality that
can be effected.
• Ability to work systematically with qualitative information. As design research has matured
and design methodology progressed, design processes with component methods and tools have
been developed and refined. As one such
process, Structured Planning9 contains a tool-kit
of methods for a complete range of planning
tasks covering ways to find information, gain insights from it, organize it optimally for conceptualization, evaluate results and communicate a
plan to the public and follow-on teams in the development process. Methods such as this are
qualitative information handling techniques applicable to many kinds of conceptual problems
where complex, system solutions are desirable.
They are also usable by anyone working on a
planning team, enabling systematic aspects of
design thinking to be made accessible to all.

Design Education to Serve New Clients
The characteristics enumerated above are not
those normally listed in a catalog for a design
course. These are special ways of design
thinking, almost implicit in the nature of the
design process. and usually taught tacitly in
today’s design education programs.
For most of the characteristics, this works
because design education programs are several
years in length and directed toward a career in
design. There is ample opportunity to acquire the

skills and nuances of design thinking, and a predisposition to do so exists on the part of students
because they have chosen to become designers.
For some of the characteristics, though, particularly those that have developed more recently,
tacit assimilation is not enough, and more progressive schools can be expected to institute
formal courses to teach them.
We can expect problems to appear, moreover,
when the context is changed. Teaching design
thinking, formally or tacitly, is one thing when
the context is a traditional design career in industry or a consulting office. It will be quite
another when the context is institutional or governmental policy planning. And our problem is
just that: to train a new kind of student for that
new context. To train students for roles as policy
design synthesis advisors, it will be necessary to
create a new kind of design program.
Some of the factors (Figures 24 and 25) that
will need to be considered are:
• How long should the program be? Can it
be taught in one, two or three years? Should it
be full-time or part-time—or either?
It is unlikely that a long program will be acceptable. Just as business schools have crafted
one and two year programs for executives
seeking MBA degrees, a program for policy
design synthesis will in all likelihood have to be
relatively condensed and, perhaps, packaged in
unusual time blocks and delivery means accessible to potential students already working in
design or planning fields.
• Who are the best candidates for the
program? Should candidates be recruited from
institutional/governmental positions? Should experienced senior designers be recruited?
It is not clear yet whether planners turned
design thinkers or designers turned planning
practitioners would be better. The correlated
question whether senior designers or policy staff
members would benefit more than young professionals in either field is also open. Perhaps, analogous programs for policy planning will be
instructive.
• What levels of experience and schooling
should be required for entrance to the program?
Must candidates have one or more design
degrees? What kind of experience is valuable?
Should special experience be required?
Some level of experience will almost certainly be necessary and training in both design and
planning must be undertaken, either prior to

15

entry or during the period of education. Experience can be built up through internships within
the program, and varying degrees of foundation
education can be offered as additional required
studies for deficient candidates who otherwise
would be highly qualified.

Design Education

A Program for Policy Design Synthesis
Factors to be considered
• How long should the program be? One year? Two years?
Three years?
• Who are the best candidates for the program? Should
candidates be recruited from institutions and government?
• What levels of experience and schooling should be
required for entrance to the program?

Figure 24 Education for Policy Design Synthesis: Considerations

Design Education

A Program for Policy Design Synthesis
Factors to be considered
• What is the ideal mix of design tools and thinking with
tools and thinking from other fields to best prepare
students for their working environment?
• What mix of academic and internship experience should
be planned?
• How should successful completion of the program be
judged?

Figure 25 Education for Policy Design Synthesis: Considerations

• What is the ideal mix of design tools and
thinking and tools and thinking from other fields
to best prepare students for their working environment? What tools from the available design
inventory are suitable? What modifications
should be sought? What tools from other fields
could be refined for this new use? What wholly
new tools would be desirable?
Design research will have some new fields to
probe. Tools will have to cover at least three
sectors of policy design synthesis. First, tools for
design advisors to work with other planning advisors. These will probably be information handling tools, much like Structured Planning,
where all can work together under guidance by
someone trained in using the tools. Second, tools
for design advisors to work for other planning
advisors. These will be tools that require more
design expertise, but whose use is for crystalliz-

ing concepts visually for the planning group.
Third, tools for design advisors to work away
from other planning advisors. These will probably be tools for specialized design simulation
and modeling work whose results will be important for the planning process, but whose workings require more specialized knowledge and
time use than is reasonable for team members
working directly on the planning problem.
• What mix of academic and internship experience should be planned? What form should the
educational process take? Should elements of the
program be on-site at an institutional location?
Packaging of the program will be crucial to
its success. If it achieves a high level of attention at executive levels, many otherwise highly
effective, but costly, forms of education may
become possible. Very low student-to-teacher
ratios complemented with learning settings optimally suited to the education process are an
example. The mix of experiences and forms of
involvement should be planned for maximum
effect in minimum time to appeal to a potential
student population (and clients desiring to hire
them) in position to expect—and sponsor—the
best.
• How should successful completion of the
program be judged? Course completion? Thesis
or dissertation? License? Should examiners
include internship advisors from relevant institution?
The opportunity may be here for new forms
of evaluation. Design thinking is almost never
evaluated well by testing, and almost all design
is taught by "project-oriented" learning methods.
Final research work as typified by theses and
dissertations is probably also inappropriate for
the kind of program that most likely will evolve
for policy design synthesis. A project-like demonstration of proficiency that could take a range
of possible forms might be an answer. Such a
demonstration could involve other students and
have evaluators from both the university and the
institution where the student is serving his or her
internship.
The task of creating a Policy Design Synthesis program will be difficult. Governmental and
institutional organizations must be convinced that
policy design synthesis is a valuable addition to
the advisory skills they rely upon. For that, our
professional design societies can carry the campaign. New tools will have to be created to bring
the skills of design thinking to bear on policy

problems. For that, our design research institutions and university programs can lead the way.
The problem is greater than the capabilities
of any single university. Cooperation will be
essential—to convince leaders, to create tools,
and to train students in numbers significant to
have impact—while there is still time.

Summary and Conclusions
The problems induced by a growing population
are becoming major with virtual certainty that
their number and seriousness will increase
(Figure 26). Global warming, as one of the latest
manifestations, adds levels of complication and
uncertainty almost impossible to anticipate. Decision making at the policy level must avail itself
of the best advice it can find to at once confront
disasters on increasingly grander scales, and
benefit from the emergence of extremely powerful new technologies.

Summary & Conclusions
An Opportunity

Design thinking has new value
Problems and Opportunities are Becoming Formidable
• Miracle technologies will contend with population-induced disasters
The Best Advice of Science and Design Must Be Heard
• Science excels in analysis; design excels in synthesis
Design Thinking is Different
• Design thinking is well matched to real-world problems
• Its characteristics make it ideally complementary to science
Programs for Policy Design Synthesis Should Be Initiated
• New content, processes and ways of working must be evolved
• Institutional and governmental clients must be found and convinced

Figure 26 Summary and Conclusions

To interpret the problems and possibilities of impending changes, science thinking must be solicited and heard. To explore and conceptualize
ways to proceed, design thinking must receive
equal attention. Among the many kinds of advice
available, the creative voices of discovery and
invention as embodied in the insights of scientists and the ideas of designers are critical.
Design thinking, less well known than
science thinking, has characteristics of great
value to teams dealing with complex, ill-formed
problems. Together, the characteristics of design
and science thinking form a set of complementary thought processes able to add considerable
strength to the advisory task.
Providing design thinking in an advisory capacity to governmental and institutional leaders

will require an evolution in design education,
design research and design professional activities. For design education, new programs must
be designed that bring the best of design thinking into the new context of policy planning. New
content will be necessary; new processes must be
developed and taught; and new ways of working
will have to be learned. It will be worth doing.

A Critical Role for Design
Technology

(Spring 1993): pp. 10-18)
A phenomenon very apparent to the American businessman, as well as to
any lay observer, is the wave of "restructuring" passing through the country.
It is a fact of life for seemingly all large companies, and through ripple
effects, it affects all but those companies most finely tuned to the new
realities of the marketplace. Less apparent, but of greater portent, is the
implicit recognition that new rules are taking form for how the games of
business will be played. As the recession abates, and revitalized industries
emerge, they will not return to the ways of the past; they will seek a
development philosophy for their products and services in tune with the
times. Of the factors involved in this product/service philosophy, design will
be one of the most important, as the growing interest of the business press
makes that very clear. There is little question that design will play a major
role in the kind of economic world on the horizon. The question is, What
role will that be?

The issue really involves "quality", and what is now being termed "product
integrity". To a great extent, the present opportunity for design is what it is
because of the now-general concern for quality. Most customers equate
quality with craftsmanship, an observable attribute that has been drummed
into everyone’s consciousness for at least a decade. U.S. companies and
others who needed it learned the craftsmanship lesson well in the last ten
years, and products worldwide are significantly more competitive insofar as
construction, reliability and other aspects of craftsmanship are concerned.

The Quality
Pyramid

Craftsmanship
Figure 1. The Design Core of the
Quality Pyramid reveals three levels
at which design can contribute to the
attainment of product quality.

The lesson, however, does not stop with craftsmanship. Quality is a hierarchical concept. There are higher levels of quality than craftsmanship, and
quality principles can better be explained in terms of a "Quality Pyramid"
(see Figure 1). Craftsmanship is the base of the design core of the pyramid.
At the second level, quality is expressed and revealed in details. At this
level, a better product is recognized by its better performance, easier use,
and better fit in its cultural niche. Perceptive companies are working now to
incorporate this understanding into their product development processes.
Far less well understood, but probably most important of all, is the third
level in the quality pyramid, concept. A better concept sweeps the
competition; customers are actually willing to pay more for a conceptually
better product. What distinguishes a better concept is its "rightness"—its
thorough response to all the needs of its users. And in this respect, all
users need to be considered—not just those who operate the product, but

1

those who distribute, sell, store, transport, maintain, repair, adapt and even
dispose of it.

Product Integrity

Craftsmanship
Figure 2. Product Integrity is the
capstone and cladding of the Quality
Pyramid. Products achieving product
integrity generate trust and respect not
only for product and services, but for
the company.

Beyond concept is the all-embracing idea of product integrity, the capstone
and cladding of the quality pyramid (see Figure 2). Product integrity is a
way of characterizing a product’s contribution to the perception of overall
quality through its own performance, its ability to improve associated
services and its ability to transfer approval to the company itself. Products
that achieve product integrity do so because users’ experiences with them
at all levels are uniformly happy ones—over and over again. In time, this
appreciation is translated to trust and respect, distributed in equal measure
to the product, to all the various services associated with it, and to the
company as the entity responsible.
Design technology exists in varying degrees for working at all levels of the
quality pyramid. At the level of craftsmanship, there is considerable
knowledge about how to design better products for production. Engineering
design, value engineering, design for manufacture—all contribute to
managing quality control. At the level of details, computer-aided design,
concurrent engineering and computer-aided engineering now significantly
contribute to better performance. Human factors design and interface design
are increasingly capable of dealing with human cognitive and physiological
design factors. And product designers and communication designers have
effective means for tailoring function and form to social and cultural needs.
At the third and capstone levels, the task is both more difficult and more
important. Design for concept and product integrity is more informationintensive, more complex, and potentially more rewarding. Unfortunately,
most companies either don’t know that design technology exists for these
levels or confuse it with conventional R&D or market research. A common
practice, particularly in U.S. companies, is to require assessment of the
viability of a market before resources are committed to planning a new
product. The effect, inevitably, is to skew new development drastically away
from substantial innovation and toward incremental change and cautious
evolution instead.

Markets Don’t Invent;
They Buy

Markets respond to what they are offered. They don’t invent; they buy. If
potential customers can’t be shown a new concept, they can only respond
to problems they perceive with what they already know. Not surprisingly,
there is almost never real innovation under this model—how can the
customer be expected to invent the product? Without real innovation to
show, the result of a market assessment is often that there is little or no
market for innovation. Something for senior executives to think about is the
successes of innovative products that were developed anyway. There are
always some. Sharp’s Wizard is a recent example; Goodyear’s new
Aquatred tire appears to be another. The moral of the story is that the old
advanced-planning model is critically flawed. What is missing is a process
for conceptualizing innovative products before the market studies.
At the needs-satisfying levels of today’s developed societies, wants and
needs almost never strongly stimulate new product development (as they
did following World War II when potential customers everywhere knew what
they were missing). Abraham Maslow’s famous hierarchy of personal needs
postulates seven levels of need, each of which usually must be satisfied
before the next can be addressed: physiological needs, safety and security
needs, belongingness and love needs, esteem needs, need for selfactualization, cognitive needs, and aesthetic needs. Stable, developed
societies tend to be at the higher levels, and their needs at all but the
highest levels are usually well satisfied—at least well enough relative to
2

everything available that there is little innate demand for new products. New
products at any but the most active need-levels for consumers in these
societies must offer improvements so noticeable that they reopen concerns
for how satisfactorily current products serve in comparison.
Under these conditions, needs, wants and desires appear in response to
new product offerings, rather than the other way around. The driving forces
switch to science, technology and invention, and the most appropriate form
of product planning is one that incorporates early conceptualization with
strong emphases on advanced planning, design and innovation. Design
technology for this kind of planning does exist—Structured Planning,
developed at IIT’s Institute of Design, is an example.

Design
Technology and
Advanced
Planning

Design is the likely touchstone for industrial success in the coming
decades—but it will most certainly not be the "styling" traditionally employed
at the back end of the development process. The kind of design that will
make the difference is design at the front end. It will be conceptual design
that employs advanced-planning task-force teams assembled from
appropriate functional groups company-wide, computer-supported design/planning methodology, life-cycle design thinking and a commitment to
the development and creative use of qualitative as well as quantitative
information. If success at the expected level of competition is to be
achieved, conceptually better products must be developed at a rate of
delivery that is both reliable and predictable. This will enable the introduction of dependably superior products before competitors can undercut price
and take over markets.
This strategy is called escalator delivery. Employing it, a company does not
rely on once-in-a-lifetime ideas and long periods of market monopoly with
them. Instead, it professionalizes the development of concepts with product
integrity and it regularly replaces its own successes with new ones. The
company with escalator delivery controls its markets by controlling the introduction of industry-dominating products.

New Products Await
Better Design

Surprisingly, considering the reversed roles of technology and need as
driving forces, there is actually more technology available now than
necessary to meet needs and desires at considerably higher levels. The
problem is that the effective use of design trails achievements in both basic
and applied science. It used to be that a better product only awaited better
technology. Now, it frequently awaits better design.
New generations of information-age products can be virtually whatever they
are asked to be. What should they be? Global competition suggests better
concepts. What those concepts should be is best addressed by design
technology. A rapidly widening variety of design technology tools can be
brought to bear on the problem. The spectrum of application ranges from
the first questions about the goals of a project to problems of product implementation in a naive or even hostile market environment (as sometimes
occurs in the public sector). The most crucial applications, however, are in
that portion at the earliest stages of development. Improvement in
performance here will significantly enhance a company’s competitive
position in world markets filled with increasingly sophisticated concepts.
An example of design technology developed expressly for this purpose is
Structured Planning. It is a comprehensive process with the means to
invigorate and extend the development model to meet new challenges. In
the following discussion, some of its features are presented to illustrate how
design technology can be deployed at the critical advanced-planning stage.

While this is not the forum to discuss Structured Planning in detail, the
captioned figures 3 through 13 provide some idea of the forms work takes
through key phases in the process. In what follows, there are references to
the figures where practicable; for more elaborate treatments, see the
Suggested Readings at the end of the article, most particularly, Design for
Integrity.

Reforming the
Development
Model

Solution Element

Title:

Conventional planning for product development suffers from problems both
of breadth and depth. The breadth problem is that too little attention is paid
to the what question before considering the how. The conventional model
for development too often begins with the project statement already well
down the road of specificity. On a scale from "What should we do?" to
"Follow this specification", it is much more likely to be near the latter than
the former. The product probably is already in mind before the development
process begins. It may be a response inspired by the competition’s new
product, an idea that occurred recently to a senior executive, or just some
new features for the current model that ought to be "upgraded".

Title:

Environmental Image Mapping

After a set is designed
in virtual reality using
the Thunderdome, it is
prepared by assembling
basic Construx building
elements in an arrangement that approximates
the intended environment. The physical
Construx elements are
for the actors’ convenience only. Actors move
around tables, sit in
chairs, walk through
doors, etc. as they would
in a conventional set.

Discussion

Until now, studio productions required individualized studio sets. The entire
concept of "studio" work was built around the idea that control of the
environment could be optimized only on location – in a studio set. Movie and
television sets of the past (and today) have ranged from minimal sets, little more
than seating with controlled lighting, to mammoth, exceedingly complex and
expensive recreations of entire environments.
The revolution in computer processing of the last decade brings the concept of
set to a new level of awareness. A variety of inventions, from matting techniques
and computer-controlled movements in film making to texture mapping in
computer graphics, have made it possible to create realistic three-dimensional
images that combine human actors and environments constructed from data bases.
Environmental Image
Mapping takes
maximum advantage of
this capability both to
reduce the cost and
complexity of the sets,
and to increase the
flexibility and speed at
which sets can be
constructed and struck.
The elements of TV
Command’s studio
system are designed to
work synergistically
with this specialized
approach to virtual
reality.

1/2

Discussion (continued)

What the actors see is the skeletal Construx set with cues on surfaces wherever
they need them – on the floor, walls, desks – any flat surface. The cues, produced
with Shadow Cues and produced with Surface Pixels, are invisible to the
television audience.
What the audience sees is quite another picture. From the studio’s data bases,
detailed images are mapped into a three-dimensional model of the set maintained
in the computer. This model of the desired environment (for example the living
room of a contemporary home) is integrated with the studio cameras’ images of
the actors on the live set. The result is an image for transmission that looks as if
the actors are on location.
Essential Features

• Speeds the construction of sets and programs.
• Eliminates the high cost of authentic sets through the use of skeletal "for actors
only" structures.
• Extends possibilities for program settings to the entire range of environments
capturable as images in visual data bases.
• Exploits virtual reality processes to enable the same image data to be used for
design and finished productions.

Figure 3. The end product of Structured Planning is a Plan, with a number of Solution Elements, each descibing ideas and specifying
their essential features. The Plan is the "Problem Statement" for the detail design work next in the development process. This example of a
Solution Element (and other examples to follow) is from a demonstration of how Sony Corporation might implement Structured Planning.
The project considers television production systems for the turn of the century.

Saddling the development team with this kind of start is like setting a
record-attempting mountaineering team on a trek up the wrong mountain.
The team may do a splendid job of finding the best way to the top, but that
will soon be forgotten when a higher peak comes into view. Real effort must

be spent on developing a good concept—just as it must be spent on turning
a good concept into a good product. The first task of reforming the
development model is to provide a focus for concept development.
The depth problem concerns finding the potential users of a product and
determining their needs. We hear much today about listening to the
"customer", but Unfortunately, what is meant by "customer" is usually far too
shallow a characterization. These customers are most likely just the
purchasers and operators of the product. Good design requires a much
deeper look than that. Users properly include everyone who lays a hand on
the product, or in any other way has something to do with it that might be
affected by its design.

Question at Issue

Eduardo Sciammarella

What provision should be made for the storage of
equipment and its expedient retrieval?

Project

TV Command

Position

Constraint, Objective or Directive

Storage and retrieval elements must prevent
damage to equipment and optimize access, both in
the field and in the studio.

Constraint
Background and Arguments

There are several situations in which proper storage and fast retrieval of equipment
are critical to operations. Field operations are a good example. Operations in the
field, by definition, imply changing environments that place priority on the
protection of equipment -- and, thus, storage and retrieval. Design for retrieval
becomes important when time constraints are considered. It is absolutely necessary,
for the continuous flow of information, to have the right equipment in place, on
time.
Transport is another mode of operation that places equipment in potentially
damaging situations. In the field, the need for care in transport and fast return to
action is obvious. In the studio, relative permanence of location is deceptive.
Equipment is moved to the studio, between studios, within a studio as changing
setups demand, and in and out of use as equipment is changed or replaced.
The nature of the technologies used in for the production and transmission of
information dictates the use of thoughtful strategies to protect fragile systems.
Sound collecting systems can be easily broken; light collecting systems require
clean optics -- unscratched and unfouled by destructive environments; electronic
systems must be protected from heat, cold and shock. Field use requires special
attention to storage and retrieval. Studio use is less traumatic, but equipment will
be moved, and thought must be given to its protection.

Alternative Positions

• Equipment must be designed to be self-protecting so that it does not require
separate storage elements.
• Individualized storage and retrieval elements must be designed to meet special
equipment needs in the field and in the studio.

Figure 5. Defining Statements extend the project statement and help to bound the problem.
This Constraint sets goals for finding good fit for "storage and retrieval".

Breadth

Structured Planning deals with the breadth problem directly by separating
the concept and detail phases of the development process. In doing so, it
forces serious consideration of what the product should be; allows extensive
creative thinking at an early, formative level; and encourages broad participation from a range of centers of expertise. The result of a Structured
Planning study is a "Plan" made up of a number of "Solution Elements",
each with a description and discussion of features (see Figure 3). The
Solution Elements may be physical, procedural or organizational. That is to
say, they may be hardware (mechanisms, system components, form
treatments, human-factored configurations), software (computer programs,
communications, operation manuals, interfaces), or "linkware" (organization

5

structures, event schedules, service plans, policy descriptions). Where
appropriate, they are given visual form with fast prototyping software, such
as the Alias software used in the Sony project figured here.
In concert, the elements of a plan make up a comprehensive description of
a concept that can be criticized and modified before time and resources
have been committed to engineering or producing anything. Issues of
purpose, benefits, desired qualities, operational characteristics, appropriate
technologies and a host of other important topics can be explored at a level
sufficiently above the detail design level that thinking can easily change as
ideas evolve. Castles in the air are easier to demolish and rebuild than
castles on the ground.

Figure 6. Action Analysis produces a Function Structure from a top-down analysis of a project’s Modes of behavior and the Activities
within them. In this example, Modes are in bold, Activities are in bold italic (at the base of the tree), and system and user Functions are in
columns under the Activities. The Edit Submode (outlined) was not considered further in this project.

Depth

The depth problem is addressed by a phase of Structured Planning called
Action Analysis. Its purpose is to establish what the product, system,
service or other entity being planned must do (actions labeled Functions);
to gain insight about what happens as Functions are performed (observations recorded in documents called Design Factors); and to collect
on-the-spot ideas (Speculations for how to use the insights inventively).
In the normal development process, the search for information usually
reaches only the primary users of the product—those who own it and
operate it for its intended use. Those it misses are the very users who could
reveal many of the needs that should be considered in the product’s design.
They are the many secondary and auxiliary users of the product—those
who make it, distribute it, store it, transport it, sell it, maintain it, repair it,
remodel it, recycle it or retire it. Through the eyes of each of these "users",
a product looks radically different. Each sees it in terms of the Functions he
6

or she has to perform with it, and each viewpoint can contribute insights to
the development of a better concept. Action Analysis directs information
collecting through the top-down creation of a Function Structure (see Figure
6). This tree-building process assures that a full range of users will be
considered and deep coverage will be given to their needs.
A Function Structure is a three-level hierarchy topped with the project label
and successively layered below with Modes of operation, Activities and,
finally, Functions. Modes of operation are the major kinds of behavior
alluded to above—maintenance, repair, retirement, etc.—along with "use",
the only mode frequently considered. Activities are the sets of actions users
engage in to accomplish the tasks required by the Modes. The actions
performed by users and system during an Activity are recorded as
Functions.
Under analysis (see Figure 7), an Activity comes to life as a "scene" in a
play. Users are the players, system elements are the props, and environmental elements make up the set. As an analyst plays out a scene, the

Because a normal studio recording event requires
many participants and a
wide range of equipment,
what is intended and what
actually takes place are
sometimes at odds.

It is the goal of the director (as well as all involved)
to produce images and sound according to the script.
Achieving a continuous flow of images and sound
without error reduces costs, improves working efficiencies and produces a better final product.

B

There are significant variations in the way television
programs are recorded. Some are highly-crafted, polished productions, others strive for immediacy and
are direct and raw. Each kind of production requires
its own controlled "filtration" of the potential actions
of personnel and arrangements of equipment. For a highend production, a sound boom drooping into the frame
is simply not allowable; another program might use
such "human" errors as signatures of the show.
Covering the entire style range, unfortunately, means
accommodating the strictest requirements. Cameras
must be able to move freely unobstructed by floor-laid
cables and improperly placed equipment. Lights must
track fluidly and maintain positions rigidly. Operators
must move inconspicuously, without noise and without intruding shadows. Microphones must anticipate
movement and maintain relative position without entering the frame of action. The key to all of this is
organized communication – the right information to
the right person at the right time.

Figure 7. The Action Analysis form is used to identify Functions and Design Factors associated with an Activity. It helps an analyst to cover an
Activity thoroughly. A Design Factor records insights and information about Functions (Observation and Extension) along with ideas for how to use
that knowledge (Design Strategies and Speculations). A and B keys show how documents are associated.

actions of users and system can be pinpointed and recorded, either
actually, where the Activity is observable, or intentionally, where the Activity
will be created by the project. The result is hundreds of Functions, all of
concern to the advanced-planning team. Successfully fulfilling them will
ensure a high probability of success for the project.

7

Considerable additional depth is provided by "insights" about how the
Functions are performed. These are recorded in Design Factor documents,
probing, discussing and highlighting what can go wrong (or right) when a
Function is performed. Written at the time an Activity is under scrutiny,
these documents seek out the precious insights that trigger inventive
product and system features. Because ideas follow insights almost hand-inhand, the Design Factor format also demands ideas for how to use the
insight and includes them in the record as "Speculations". These ideas may
or may not be used ultimately, but they will exist in the information base,
captured when they were formed.
Cross-referenced to the Functions they illuminate, Design Factors provide a
"project memory" that is intentionally qualitative rather than quantitative. The
format is narrative, but discussions can be supported with quantitative data
as well as visual illustrations. This sets a style for unconstrained observation
and explanation able to supply the rich detail frequently important to nuance
and thorough understanding. As an archive for a project, Design Factors
and their associated Functions constitute a project memory; by extension,
these project memories become a corporate memory that remembers why
things were done—and does not quit or retire.
Building the Function Structure creates the information base. The structure
itself, however, is fundamentally flawed for the tasks of using the
information. For optimal use of the hundreds of Functions and Design
Factors, a more suitable structure must be constructed from the bottom up.

Having insightful information in breadth and depth is necessary, but not
sufficient. It must also be in the right place at the right time. The problem
with information is that the more there is of it, the more difficult it is to
organize. Given the ambitious goals of holistic, creative concepts, it is particularly important that information be juxtaposed in such a way that
maximum synergy is generated among the ideas that come up for consideration. In other words, concept building would be best served if the

8

components of the proposed concept elegantly solved multiple problems,
performed multiple functions, and did all with an economy of means. The
elegant solution not only does things with style, it does them with a
simplicity that belies the effort that went into its design. To bring these kinds
of concepts into being, the advanced-planning team needs to have the right
information when they need it, whether or not they know that they need it.

In the structuring phase of Structured Planning, two computer programs,
RELATN and VTCON, organize the information produced by Action
Analysis. The RELATN program (see Figure 8) uses a special "measure of
interaction" to establish links between Functions in the information base. It
does so not by membership in a common category, the usual means for
establishing association in a database, but by the likelihood of Functions
being fulfilled by the same component or components of a design solution
(the Speculations produced during the development of the Design Factors).

in a "repair" category; all Functions concerned with transport in the "transportation" category). The RELATN program associates them, instead, by
their potential for being fulfilled by the same design ideas—whatever their
previous categorization might have been.

Figure 13. Using Ends/Means Synthesis, a description of system need taken from the results of
the Means/Ends Analysis is subjected to idea generation at successively more refined layers.
The process ends when specific Solution Elements for all needs have been invented or
selected, refined and modified from Speculations. These are then evaluated against the
Functions from the original Means/Ends Analysis and written up as elements of the Plan.

The VTCON program (see Figure 9) operates on the network of linked
Functions produced by the RELATN program. It first finds clusters of highly
interlinked Functions and then, looking at links crossing cluster boundaries
and Functions common to more than one cluster, "condenses" the clusters
to larger, inclusive clusters at higher levels until a final level is reached at
which all Functions are represented (see Figure 10). This hierarchical
Information Structure (see Figure 11), created from the bottom up, is the
optimal organization to support the synthesis activities of the advancedplanning team.

Conclusions and
Recommendations

Design technology has many roles—all important—to play in the evolving
new product development process. Most critical, however, is its role at the
beginning because it can be so influential and effective there. Toward implementation in this role, the following recommendations are guidelines:
• As policy, strengthen the use of design technology at all levels of the
Quality Pyramid. Quality will be measured by more than just craftsmanship
in the competition ahead.
• Embrace product integrity as an umbrella goal for product, system and
service attainment. As an overarching idea, it directs all aspects of producer/consumer/observer relations and places lesser goals in proper
perspective.
• Separate conceptual levels of designing from detail levels of designing—in
the same way that strategy is separated from tactics. Freed by the
separation, the concept development process can be reframed as a
"task-force" activity.
• Prepare an initially small number of design-trained staff as leaders for
advanced-planning teams. Training in the skills necessary for creative team
work and the design technology for information-intensive planning will
enable this nucleus group to transfer the technology in the process of using
it.
• Periodically commission compact, interdisciplinary, advanced-planning
teams of selectees, on loan from appropriate functional groups, with a
nucleus designer as leader to conceptualize "products after next". When
their projects are completed, these team members will be the ideal
champions in their specialty areas for the detail development to follow.
• Treat selection for an advanced-planning team as an award for creative,
team-supportive service, and extend it progressively to the widest range of
employees possible. Through participation on advanced-planning teams, a
cadre of knowledgeable personnel experienced in creative planning will be
built up to institute the concepts throughout the corporate culture.
• When enough projects have beeb completed to justify it, establish an
information base to make the accumulated knowledge available to future
teams. As the level of training extends through the company, entries to the
information base should be sought across the spectrum of corporate associations with products, services and users. Information generated at these
points of contact is the means for instituting life-cycle design practices that
can influence new product development as well as old product revision and
upgrade.
Design technology is no longer the plaything of academicians; it is a fact of
business. Industry is now entering an era in which those who understand
11

and use it effectively will win; those who do not will lose. Product-integrity
quality must be the standard. The goal should be planning that can achieve
it—reliably and predictably—on an escalator delivery schedule.

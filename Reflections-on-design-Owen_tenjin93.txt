Reflections on Design: Process for Change
Charles L. Owen
A speech given at the Tenjin Barca Festival in Osaka, Japan on July 23, 1993

Good morning. In the few minutes that I have, I would like to share with you some thoughts
about the design process. As a speaker on an occasion like this, I feel that I can only tell
you what you already know, but, perhaps, I can present some views differently enough that
they may be thought-provoking.
What I want to do is reflect upon how we, as designers, do what we do.
Let me start by thinking about the place of
design (Fig. 1).

Context
• Nature
• Time and space

Nature existed and evolved for millions of
years without people. It is the ultimate
context for what we do.

As an evolved species, mankind is
peculiarly unprepared to exist in the natural
world (Fig. 2). Unless our most basic
physical needs are met, we will die. And
unless we can find ways to live in harmony
with our environment, we will not be able to
meet our physical needs.

To be successful in an often very hostile
environment, we have been gifted above
other animals with two almost magical
extensions: tools and language (Fig. 4).

But the environment for man is more than
nature. Because we are social animals, we
also must satisfy social needs and find ways
to exist in social harmony (Fig. 3). Our true
environment is both social and natural.

14

The ability to make sophisticated tools
allows us to construct marvelous artifacts –
from the simplest forms of body protection
to the most complex vehicles and environmental structures (Fig. 5).
The ability to use language allows us to
communicate and to construct institutions to
mediate our social intercourse.
These form the interfaces between us and
the natural and social environments.
Design is the creation process through
which we employ tools and language to
invent artifacts and institutions (Fig. 6). As
society has evolved, so has design. And it
continues to evolve in complexity and
capability as we learn and improve our
design technology.

I would like us to focus our attention on
design as a process of creation (Fig. 7).

Design is a time-dependent process (Fig. 8).
It builds on the past, improving on previous
ideas. It projects to the future, anticipating
inevitable change. But it occupies the
present; like matsuri, it exists between past
and future.

Design is also a structured process (Fig. 9).
While its phases are not locked in rigid
progression, it nearly always begins with
analytic processes of search and understanding, and ends with synthetic processes
of experimentation and invention.

When the diagram is straightened out, it is
easier to see a left analytic region and a
right synthetic region. In the left region, the
domain of analytic focus is the context of
the design problem, spanning aspects of
past and present. In the right region, the
domain of synthetic focus is the artifacts
and institutions to be designed.

The simplest and oldest way of creating is
"form making", the direct translation of
contextual understanding to artifact or
institution (Fig. 10).

As our civilizations have matured, our understanding of creation and production
processes have deepened (Fig. 11). Today,
we need another axis in our diagram to
describe them. The new axis distinguishes
the abstract from the real, establishing the
abstract as the realm in which the specification for an artifact or institution is created.
"Making", today, is most often a real,
synthetic process of production, divorced
from both analytic and abstract requirements.

No matter how we create forms, however,
we evaluate their quality. On the left of the
slide, I have begun a model for evaluating
quality. At the level of "making", manufacturing, or construction, we evaluate quality as
craftsmanship.

Modern thinking adds another layer to the
creation process – planning or, as it is
sometimes called, design planning (Fig. 13).
Planning separates the creation of concepts
from the creation of details, so that concepts
can be developed more thoroughly at a
higher level of abstraction. Planning is done
most effectively by multi-discipline teams,
led by designers trained in planning
methodology.
The quality of planning is measured in the
concept. A good concept exhibits significant
holistic and innovative characteristics, and is
qualitatively superior to conventional
products.

Quality produced in the designing process is
measured in the details of the product.
These are aspects of its performance,
human factors and cultural fit. The business
community is now beginning to realize how
important these forms of quality are to the
success of products.

The appearance of the design specialist
separated the act of specifying an artifact or
institution from the act of producing it.
Designing is in the realm of the abstract
(Fig. 12). When we design, we extract
insight from the facts and observations of
context, convert insights to ideas and give
them form through a specification passed to
the making process.

F u t u r e

More a subject of research today than an
established phase of the creation process,
metaplanning operates at the highest level
of abstraction (Fig. 14). It separates the
definition of the project from the planning
and designing processes. Metaplanning
focuses attention on resources, methods
and the issues to be addressed in a project.
Because the purview of metaplanning is
broad, its effect on quality can be pervasive.
Quality resulting from action at this level can
be measured in the integrity of a product: its
appropriateness, cohesiveness and support
for values, both of the organization for which
it was created and the society in which it is
to be used.

The model for measuring quality is what I
call the Quality Pyramid (Fig. 15). It is both
a model for thinking about quality beyond
craftsmanship, and a model that reflects the
sophistication possible in the creation
process. Each phase of the creation
process finds its place in the harmony of the
model.

p e ra tion

The sometimes-contrasting requirements of
nature and society are not the only requirements creating tensions for design.
Designers today face questions of value that
will influence our approach to the future. I
call them "tensions" and cast them as
polarities or "spectrum" issues because
thinking in this way is easy to grasp and
apply (Fig. 16).
These "tensions" act as filters on our
thinking; controls on our use of the design
process, particularly at the metaplanning
and planning levels. I will introduce three as
food for our thinking about responsible
design for the future.
The first tension is between self and society
(Fig. 17). As world populations inexorably
increase, our environment continues to
degrade, and the gap widens between the
world’s wealthy and poor, we must seriously
consider how our efforts contribute to
individuals’ views of themselves and society.
It is important for individuals to value and
improve themselves, but it is equally
important for individuals to value and
improve society.
As our nations build the new global
economy, we will hear over and over again
the importance of successful competition.
Less frequently heard, but perhaps much
more important, will be the importance of
cooperation (Fig. 18). We must ask
ourselves how we can contribute to finding
balance between these two powerful ideas.
Design can have subtle influence at many
levels – from children’s toys and games to
national policies.

Electronic media are homogenizing our
cultures. While it is comforting to find
familiar artifacts and institutions as we
travel, it is dismaying to watch the delightful
differences of old and wonderful cultures
disappear. We gain significantly through
communication and the creation of commonalities, but we must find ways to recognize
and celebrate the things that make our
cultures special (Fig. 19).

Design in its various professional forms is
entering a time of great attention. There will
be both excitement and anxiety under the
spotlight.
Society needs design – and it is discovering
that.
But design needs maturity. We are illprepared for the attention coming our way. If
we are to assume the responsibility we have
so often requested, we must devote serious
effort to building the reservoir of knowledge
necessary to assume it (Fig. 20).

It is time for the design disciplines to grow up; time to commit human and financial resources
to institutions for design. We need centers for research, better educational curricula and a
range of channels for sharing knowledge. We must build rapidly what other disciplines have
built before us.
If we do so, I am confident that the next century will a golden one for design.
